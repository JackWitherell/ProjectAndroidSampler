## TODO

| *By Week* | *Task* |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | design base project and begin style guidelines |
| 2 | begin research and begin implementing audio library |
| 3 | ensure audio playback, based on api functionality, decide future path |

## Known Issues / Current Work

- Add more code, mockups, start researching audio apis

## Future Tasks / Projected Roadblocks

- When 'deciding future path' on week 3, determine whether work should go towards making a timeline marker system for editing, or if work should go towards making a marker system for playing back sections on the timeline.
